PLEASE NOTE: the skins.htaccess file in this directory is intended to prohibit, for enhanced security, direct access .inc and .php files in the skin folders. Depending on the web server configuration, the code in this .htaccess file may not work as intended. In this case, your site will be displayed incorrectly, with missing content or style. Renaming the .htaccess file should fix the problem.

To apply it, follow these instructions:

1. Be sure that another .htaccess file does not exist in the /skins folder
2. Copy the skins.htaccess file into the skins folder of your Nucleus CMS installation
3. Rename the file to .htaccess
4. If you have an existing .htaccess file in your skins folder, copy the contents from the skins.htaccess file into the existing .htacces file.

You can disable after installing it by renaming the file to something else, or by removing the file from that folder.
