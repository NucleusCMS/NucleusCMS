	<h1>Nucleus CMS - classic skin</h1>

	<p>Default Nucleus CMS skin based on the Stanch skin contributed by <a href="http://www.stanch.net/">Stanch</a> with assistance from <a href="http://roelg.nl/">roel</a>.</p>

	<p>Default skin's skin/templates/includes tweaked by <a href="http://nupusi.com/">hcgtv</a>, CSS color scheme by <a href="http://smalltalking.com/">moraes</a>.</p>

	<br />

	<p>If you want drop shadow effect for your images when you blog, you have to add 3 div's surrounding the image. Start with &lt;div class="wrap1"&gt;, followed by &lt;div class="wrap2"&gt;, and then &lt;div class="wrap3"&gt;. Remember to close them with &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;. Please note also that the drop shadow has float:left style applied to it.</p>

	<p>On the comments page, you will notice that the owner (Nucleus administrator) has a different kind of styling to his/her comments, as opposed to the comments made by visitors. This is made possible using CSS. I have included short comments in the CSS file, I'm sure it is easy to understand, in case you want to remove this styling or you want to add styling for different members.</p>

	<br />
	<p>Default skin files:</p>
	<p>left.css - left side menu CSS code, change it in head.inc</p>
	<p>right.css - right side menu CSS code, default CSS in head.inc</p>
	<p>skinbackup.xml - backup of classic skin, can be reimported just in case</p>
	<p>/images - background, header, footer and misc images</p>

	<br />
	<p>This skin makes use of includes for skin abstraction:</p>
	<p>head.inc - html header</p>
	<p>navigation.inc - navigation & page titles</p>
	<p>header.inc - page header</p>
	<p>sidebar.inc - page menu</p>
	<p>footer.inc - page footer</p>

	<br />
	<p>Extra files:</p>
	<p>favicon.ico - sample favorite icon, copy to site's root directory</p>

	<br />
	<p>Note: chmod 666 the .inc files in the /skins/classic directory.</p>
