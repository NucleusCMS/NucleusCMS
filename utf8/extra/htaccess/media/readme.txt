Nucleus Media Directory
-----------------------

Uploaded images will end up in the media directory.

Subdirectories work as follows:

* numeric (e.g. /media/1/)

Media files for a certain member (directory name is the memberid)

* other directories (e.g. /media/common/)

Global media collections that can be used by any member that is on a team. In order to create a new collection, simply create a new directory and assure write access is enabled for it.
