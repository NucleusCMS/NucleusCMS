<h1>Nucleus Popup Help</h1>
<p>Please hold on while the page is being downloaded (about 390KB).</p>
</div>


<div class="page">
<a name="future"></a>
<a name="allowpastposting"></a>
<h1>Add Later/Earlier</h1>
<h2>Add Later</h2>
<p>The 'Add Later' option on add-item forms allows you to mark an item to become visible only at the exact time you've specified. Before that time has come, the item will not be viewable anywhere in the public part of your site.</p>
<p>This date <strong>must</strong> be in the future, unless the 'Allow posting to the past' option is enabled for the blog to which you want to add the item.</p>
<h2>Allow posting to the past</h2>
<p>When enabled, you'll be allowed to specify the date on which an item should be added, and to edit the timestamp of already existing items.</p>
</div>

<div class="page"><a name="changedate"></a>
<h1>Change post date/time</h1>
<p>
The 'Update Timestamp' option allows you to change the posting date and/or time of an item. If you changed the content of an item, this is a way bring the story back to the top of your front page.</p>
<p>But, the unique id connected to the item will not change, so your visitors can still find out that the item was originally posted later than items with a lower id.</p>
</div>


<div class="page"><a name="autosave"></a>
<h1>Autosave</h1>
<p>The Autosave function saves an item as a <a href="#draft">draft</a> after 10 minutes editing. It should avoid that unsaved changes get lost. It is usefull for users that work for a long time on an item and often forget to save their work.</p>
<p>If you want to invoke Autosave before the 10 minutes are past, you can press the '<strong>Auto save now</strong>' button at the end of the form.</p>
<p>The Autosave function can be enabled and disabled in the member options.</p>
</div>


<div class="page"><a name="draft"></a>
<h1>Drafts</h1>
<p>
Draft items are not yet viewable in the public blog. They might come in handy when you are working on a story, and something comes in between. Your draft items will be listed on the main page, so you can continue your work when you have the time to do so.</p>
<p>When editing drafts, choose the '<strong>Add now</strong>' radiobutton and hit the 'Edit item' button to make them visible.
</p>
</div>

<div class="page"><a name="extended"></a>
<h1>Extended part</h1>
<p>
Items have an optional extended part that you can use for continued stories. e.g. when a story is too long to put on the main page of your blog, you can write an introduction in the body part and the rest in the extended part. When viewing your main blog page, you will then see 'read more' links (as defined by the templates).
</p>
<p>
If you want to write an introduction only for <em>some</em> of your items, you could use the <a href="#templatevar-smartbody">smartbody</a> template variable to make a selection out of the body text and the extended text.
</p>
</div>

<div class="page"><a name="shortblogname"></a>
<h1>Short Blog Name</h1>
<p>
The short blog name is used mainly in the admin area to indicate which items are associated with which blog.
</p>
<p>
It can also be used in alternative index files, to make a second weblog available:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;?
	include('./config.php');
	selectBlog('myshortblogname');
	selector();
?&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<div class="page"><a name="blogdefaultskin"></a>
<h1>Default Skin</h1>
<p>
The default skin selected in the blog settings is the skin that should be used when the blog is displayed, and there is no other skin selected (through arguments in the URL)
</p>
</div>


<div class="page"><a name="blognotify"></a>
<h1>Notify Address</h1>
<p>
This option contains one or multiple e-mail addresses to which notification e-mails should be sent when new comments are added. Leave empty if you don't want notification. The given e-mail addresses must, of course, be valid.
</p>
<p>
If you're using multiple addresses, you should use a semicolon (<strong>;</strong>) as a separator.
</p>
<div class="note">
<b>Note:</b> As the maximum length of the settings fields is 128 characters, there's only a limited amount of e-mail addresses you can list.
</div>
<div class="note">
<b>Note:</b> When you set up your own e-mail address as notification address, you won't get notified of the items/comments that you wrote yourself. Assuming that you know what you wrote, that shouldn't be a problem.
</div>
</div>

<div class="page"><a name="blogmaxcomments"></a>
<h1>Max Amount of Comments</h1>
<p>
This is the maximum number of comments that will be shown on the <em>main page</em>. <strong>This is NOT a restriction on the total number of comments that can be made</strong>. On the detail pages, all comments will be shown, even if there are more than the maximum amount chosen.
</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
Inside templates, this variable can be overridden by an optional parameter of the <a href="#templatevar-comments">comments</a> templatevar.
</p>
</div>

<div class="page"><a name="blogtimeoffset"></a>
<h1>Time Offset</h1>
<p>
If the time on your server is not equal to the time where you live, you might want to add an offset to the server time in order to get the correct time. Use negative values to subtract (negation sign). The current server time is listed as a reference.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>If your local time is 20:35 and the server time is listed as 14:35, you'll need to set the time offset equal to 6 in order to get your blog time to 20:35
</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Fractional offsets can be used as well, for people living in half time zones. e.g. an offset of <strong>1.5</strong> equals an offset of 1 hour and 30 minutes.</p>
</div>

<div class="page"><a name="blogupdatefile"></a>
<h1>Update File</h1>
<p>
Nucleus can edit a file for you whenever a new item is added to the blog. The contents of that file will be a timestamp of the last change. The use of such a file could be useful for services which check a file on your server once in a while to see if there were updates, and generate 'updated weblogs' from that. Pointing them to your main blog could cause false update warnings to be sent out when visitors add comments or when you change something to the skins or templates.
</p>
<p>
When you don't need an update file, just leave the field empty.
</p>
<p>
Please note that the location of the update file is relative to the admin-area, so you might want to use an absolute path (something like <tt>/path/to/your/website/update.txt</tt>). Also make sure the update file already exists and is writable (<a href="tips.html#filepermissions" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="out" title="quick guide on changing file permissions">chmod it to 666</a> if you want to be sure).
</p>
</div>

<div class="page"><a name="teamadmin"></a>
<h1>Blog Admin</h1>
<p>
Blog administrators have the following extra rights:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>They can manage the team</li>
	<li>They can edit blog settings</li>
	<li>They can edit/delete all items by all authors (from the blog of which they are admin)</li>
	<li>They can delete the blog</li>
</ul>

<p>
A blog can have multiple admins, but there must be at least one admin at all times.
</p>
</div>


<div class="page"><a name="superadmin"></a>
<h1>Administrator Privileges</h1>

<p>
A so called <em>super-admin</em> has <strong>full access</strong> to all functions and all weblogs, even if she is not on the blog team.
</p>

<p>
On top of that: a super-admin has the right to create new weblogs, to change general settings, to change templates, to change skins and to manage the members (creation/ manipulation/ deletion of members).
</p>

<p>
Usually, there will be only one super-admin, the site administrator.
</p>

</div>

<div class="page"><a name="canlogin"></a>
<h1>Can Login?</h1>
<p>
As a <a href="#superadmin" title="Administrator Privileges">superadmin</a>, you can disallow individual members to login to the admin area.
</p>
</div>

<div class="page"><a name="defaultblog"></a>
<h1>Default Blog</h1>
<p>
This is the blog that will be used when no other blog has been specified in the request.
</p>
</div>

<div class="page"><a name="baseskin"></a>
<h1>Base Skin</h1>

<p>The option tells Nucleus which skin to fall back to when no such decision can be automatically made. This happens when skin parts are empty, when no blog or skin is implicitly/explicitly selected.</p>
<p>Most users don't need to worry about this setting.</p>
</div>

<div class="page"><a name="cookies"></a>
<h1>Cookies</h1>

<h2>Cookie Lifetime</h2>
<p>
When a member logs in, a cookie is stored in his browser, so she doesn't need to log in again when she comes back the next day. The lifetime of this cookie decided when it will become invalid:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Session cookies</strong> get deleted when you exit the browser</li>
	<li>Cookies with a lifetime of <strong>one month</strong> will stay on the computer until you don't use/visit the site for a month. Using this option, you'll never have to login again (unless you've logged out yourself, or logged in from another computer)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cookie Path &amp; Cookie Domain</h2>
<p>
These settings are advanced settings. Normally, you shouldn't change them at all. In that case, cookie path is a simple slash ('/') and cookie domain is empty.
</p>

<h2>Secure Cookies</h2>
<p>
Normally, this should be set to 'no'. You should only set it to 'yes' when you have a HTTPS url and want cookies only to be sent over such a https connection.
</p>

<h2>'Last Visit' Cookie</h2>
<p>
You can setup Nucleus to store a cookie in which the time of the visitors last visit is stored. This can be used to put indications next to <a href="#templatenew">new items</a>
</p>

</div>


<div class="page"><a name="locale"></a>
<h1>Locale</h1>
<p>
You can choose a locale to be used when nucleus creates content for you. The content generated by Nucleus includes the admin-area, the error messages, forms in skins, ...
</p>

<p>
There are two places where a translation can be chosen: the global site settings include a locale option.
Next to that, logged in members can override this setting if they want to.
</p>

<p>
When both of these settings are invalid, 'en_Latn_US' is used as the default locale.
</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Extra translation files can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.nucleuscms.org/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" class="out" title="Nucleus CMS Website">Nucleus Website</a>. (opens a new window)</p>

</div>

<div class="page"><a name="allowaccountcreation"></a>
<h1>Account Creation</h1>
<p>
You can either allow or disallow your visitors to create their own 'member' account. They won't be allowed to add items to a blog (unless the admin adds them to a team), but they can login to the administration area and change their settings, and even delete or modify the comments they made.
</p>
</div>

<div class="page"><a name="allownewmemberlogin"></a>
<h1>New Member: can login ?</h1>
<p>
When you allow <a href="#allowaccountcreation">creation of member accounts</a> by your visitors, this setting defines whether or not accounts created in that way will have the ability to <a href="#canlogin">login to the administration area</a>.
</p>
</div>


<div class="page"><a name="messageservice"></a>
<h1>Message Service</h1>

<p>
For the privacy of your members, you can hide all e-mail addresses and allow members to send an e-mail message to each other through the script. The message that will be sent out will however contain the e-mail addresses of both users, so they can then do continued communication through regular e-mail. This service can be disabled.
</p>

<h2>Non-members</h2>
<p>
By default, non members cannot use the message service (because there's no way to check the validity of the e-mail address they enter). You can relax this restriction by allowing non-members to use the message service too. When submitting a message, they will be asked to enter their e-mail address, which will show up in the <tt>From:</tt> headers of the e-mail you receive.
</p>

</div>

<div class="page"><a name="disablesite"></a>
<h1>Disable Site</h1>
<p>
It's possible to disable your entire Nucleus site. You might want to do this when you are doing some configuration, or when something went horribly wrong :-)
</p>
<p>
The URL that needs to be configured is an URL to which the visitor will be redirected.
</p>
<p>
Exceptions: the <strong>admin-area</strong> is still available, and <strong><a href="#superadmin">super-admins</a></strong> can still see the entire site. (don't forget to re-enable your site afterwards ;-))
</p>
</div>


<div class="page"><a name="urlmode"></a>
<h1>URL Mode</h1>
<p>Using this option, you can switch between URL styles:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Normal</strong>: URLs looking like <code>http://host/index.php?itemid=1234</code></li>
	<li><strong>Fancy</strong>: URLs looking like <code>http://host/item/1234</code></li>
</ul>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> In order to get the 'Fancy URL' mode working, some extra actions are required. They're described in the <a href="tips.html" class="out" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tips &amp; Suggestions</a> (opens in new window)</p>

</div>

<div class="page"><a name="defaultlistsize"></a>
<h1>Default List Size</h1>
<p>(3.40) Using this option, you can set the default size of lists in the Admin Area. Value should be an integer. 10 is a good default for most users.</p>
</div>

<div class="page"><a name="debugvars"></a>
<h1>Debug Vars</h1>
<p>(3.40) Using this option, you can set whether unresolved Vars (SkinVars, TemplateVars, ItemVars) are shown on the blog. Default is <code>No</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="page"><a name="templateitems"></a>
<h1>Templates: Items</h1>
<p>
When items are shown, the following setup is repeated for each item:
</p>

<pre>
item header
item body
item footer
</pre>

<p>These three blocks all refer to a template-part, which define what the result looks like.</p>

<h2>Variables</h2>

<p>Within these template, a series of so called <a href="#templatevars-overview" title="Find out which variables are available">template variables can be used</a> to insert item data.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p><a href="#templateitemsexample">An example</a></p>

</div>

<div class="page"><a name="templateitemsexample"></a>
<h1>Templates: Items</h1>
<p>
An example for the <b>item body</b> template:
</p>

<pre>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;%title%&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;%body%&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="metadata"&gt;
 &lt;a href="&lt;%itemlink%&gt;"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; -
 &lt;%date%&gt; &lt;%time%&gt; -
 &lt;a href="&lt;%authorlink%&gt;"&gt;&lt;%author%&gt;&lt;/a&gt; -
 &lt;%comments%&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<p>The result would become something like this:</p>

<div class="example">
<h4 style="margin: 2px;">This is an item</h4>
<p style="margin: 2px; padding: 0px;">This is the text for the item</p>
<div style="font-style: italic; margin: 2px;">
 <a href="#templateitemsexample">link</a> -
 August 8th 2002 18:51 -
 <a href="#templateitemsexample">karma</a> -
 <a href="#templateitemsexample">no comments</a>
</div>
</div>

</div>


<div class="page"><a name="templatecomments"></a>
<h1>Templates: comments</h1>

<p>There are three possible structures for a comments block.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		When comments are displayed (like on detail pages, or on the main page when there are less than the maximum allowed amount of comments)
<pre>comments header
  comments body (repeated)
comments footer</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		When there are no comments at all
<pre>
no comments
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		When there are comments, but there are more than the maximum allowed number. (only applies when not on a detailed item page)
<pre>
too much comments
</pre>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Inside these template-parts, some <a href="#templatevars-comments" title="Overview of comments-related template variables">comments-related variables</a> are available</p>

</div>

<div class="page">
<a name="templatecommentheaders"></a>
<a name="templatecommentfooters"></a>
<h1>Templates: Comment headers/footers</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>While the comments-body is repeated for each comment, the header and footer are only displayed once. A typicall structure would look like this:</p>
<pre>comments header
  comments body 1
  comments body 2
  comments body 3
comments footer</pre>
<p>In these template-parts, <a href="#templatevars-comments" title="Overview of comments-related template variables">comments-related templatevars</a> are available</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Header:</p>
<pre>&lt;ul&gt;</pre>
<p>Body:</p>
<pre>&lt;li&gt;&lt;%user%&gt;: &lt;%body%&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</pre>
<p>Footer</p>
<pre>&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
<p>Result</p>

<ul class="example">
	<li>karma: nice!</li>
	<li>xiffy: yes indeed!</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="page"><a name="templatemorelink"></a>
<h1>Templates: Link to extended entry</h1>
<p>
This is the template that will be used to format the <a href="#templatevar-morelink">morelink templatevar</a> that is available in the item templates. <a href="#templatevars-overview">Available variables</a> are the same as in the item templates.
</p>
<p>
When there's no extended part of the item, the <code>&lt;%morelink%&gt;</code> templatevar will have no effect.
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<pre><code>&lt;a href="&lt;%itemlink%&gt;"&gt;[Read More!]&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

</div>

<div class="page"><a name="templatearchivelists"></a>

<h1>Templates: Archive Lists</h1>

<p>The archive lists are formatted as listed below:</p>

<pre>archivelist header
  archivelist listitem (repeated for each archive)
archivelist footer</pre>

<p>
Available variables: (in the header and footer, only <tt>blogid</tt> is allowed)
</p>

<table><tr>
	<th>Name</th>
	<th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
	<td>blogid</td>
	<td>ID of the weblog</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>archivelink</td>
	<td>link to the archive, which you can embed in a <code>&lt;a href=".."&gt;</code> tag.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>month</td>
	<td>Number of the month (2 digits: 01-12)</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>year</td>
	<td>Year (4 digits)</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>day</td>
	<td>Day of month (2 digits; only when in day mode)</td>
</tr></table>

<p>A more flexible way to add the date of the archive to the listitem, is to use <a href="#strftime">strftime</a> variables. If you find this too complicated, use the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="&lt;%archivelink%&gt;"&gt;%B, %Y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</code></pre>


<p>To change the locale to your local settings, change the <a href="#templatelocale">locale</a>.</p>

</div>




<div class="page"><a name="templatecategorylists"></a>
<h1>Templates: Category Lists</h1>

<p>The category lists are formatted as listed below:</p>

<pre>categorylist header
  categorylist listitem (repeated)

</tr><tr>
	<td>catid</td>
	<td>Category ID</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>catname</td>
	<td>Category name</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>catdesc</td>
	<td>Category description</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>catiscurrent</td>
	<td>yes if category is currently selected, no if it is not. Useful to style current category.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>currentcat</td>

<h1>Templates: Locale</h1>
<p>
This is actually not a template-part, it's a setting. Setting it allows the date and time preferences when to be localized. Names of months and days will be in the desired locale, etc.
</p>

<p>
The possible values depend according to which machine Nucleus is running on. Some possible values are
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>en</strong>: English</li>
	<li><strong>dutch</strong>: Dutch</li>
	<li>...</li>

These are used to format dates and times into the <code>&lt;%date%&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;%time%&gt;</code> vars (see <a href="#templatevars-overview">template vars</a>). The formatting is done according to the <a href="#templatelocale">locale</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="#strftime">More info on the available vars</a>. If want to get started quickly, use "%x" to format the date and "%X" to format the time.
</p>

</div>

<div class="page"><a name="templatedateheads"></a>
<h1>Template: Date headers/footers</h1>

<p>
The date header and date footer can contain date and time vars. <a href="#strftime">More info on the available vars</a>. If you want to get started quickly, use "%x" to format the date. The locale which is used to format the date, is determined by the <a href="#templatelocale">locale-setting</a> in the template.</p>

<p>
In the date header, the template variable &lt;%%daylink%%&gt; is allowed to insert a link to the archive for that day. <strong>Note the double '%'! It's necessary to avoid %d to be expanded as the current day of the month.</strong> Also, if you just want to add a '%' character somewhere, you should also put it twice ('%%') or it will be gone on your website.
</p>

<p>
Sample for date header:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;div class="day"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;%d %B&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Sample for date footer:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>And another example for the date head using daylink</p>

<pre>
&lt;div class="day"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;%d %B&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;a href="&lt;%%daylink%%&gt;"&gt;(archive)&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

</div>

<div class="page"><a name="templatehighlight"></a>
<h1>Templates: Highlight</h1>
<p>
The highlighting is used when performing searches. This is actually used in a regular expression, so you might want to escape some characters by putting a backslash before them. The place where the highlighted word will come, is indicated by "\0".
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre><code>&lt;span style='background-color:yellow'&gt;\0&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>

</div>

<div class="page"><a name="templatenothingfound"></a>

<div class="page"><a name="templatememberextra"></a>
<h1>Templates: Member Extra</h1>
<p>
This is a template you can use to add an extra indication that a comment-author is a member. It ends up in the <code>&lt;%authtext%&gt;</code> variable for use in the <a href="#templatecommentbody">comment body</a>
</p>

<p>Inside this template-part, some <a href="#templatevars-comments" title="Overview of comments-related template variables">comments-related variables</a> are available.</p>

</div>

<div class="page"><a name="templatecommentcontinued"></a>
<h1>Templates: Comments Read More</h1>
<p>
This is the format of the link that will be added at the end of <code>&lt;%short%&gt;</code>, which is a variable for use in the <a href="#templatecommentbody">comment body</a>
</p>

<p>Inside this template-part, some <a href="#templatevars-comments" title="Overview of comments-related template variables">comments-related variables</a> are available (except for the <code>&lt;%short%&gt;</code> variable).</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
 &lt;a href="&lt;%itemlink%&gt;"&gt;[more]&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

</div>

<div class="page"><a name="templatecommentwords"></a>
<h1>Templates: commentword</h1>
<p>
Most likely, you'll rather want to write "1 comment" than "1 comment(s)". The "One comment" and "Many comments" template parts can be used for this purpose. They will be used to fill the <code>&lt;%commentword%&gt;</code> variable that you can use elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
If there is only 1 comment, <code>&lt;%commentword%&gt;</code> will be equal to the contents of the "one comment" part. If there are many comments (more than one), <code>&lt;%commentword%&gt;</code> will be equal to the contents of the "two (or more) comments" part.
</p>

<p>
Typical values are "comment" and "comments". <strong>No special variables can be used here</strong>.

  &lt;body&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;About My Site&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This page was published in order
	to provide a platform to publicize the plight
	of the peeping-polly parrot whose present
	prognosis is perturbingly pessimistic.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>

	the page look just like the other pages and use SkinVars to show an index of the whole site, or a list of members, etc...
</p>
</div>




<div class="page"><a name="shortnames"></a>
<h1>Shortnames &amp; Display Names</h1>
<p>
Weblogs, templates and skin should all have a short name next to the full name or description.
</p>

<p>
A short name consists of <strong>only</strong> the characters a-z and 0-9, and <strong>cannot</strong> contain spaces
</p>

<p>
Display names are used for members. They can contain a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and spaces, but the spaces cannot be placed at the beginning or end of the name.
</p>
</div>






<div class="page"><a name="templatenew"></a>
<h1>Template: 'New' indication</h1>
<p>
When the <a href="#cookies">'last visit' cookie</a> option is activated, the contents of the 'Indication of new item'-template is copied into the &lt;%new%&gt; variable for items that have been added since the last visit. The <code>&lt;%new%&gt;</code> variable can e.g. be used in the <a href="#templateitems">item body</a>-template.
</p>

<p>
When the 'last visit' cookie is disabled, or the item is not 'new', this template part will not be used.
</p>
</div>


<div class="page"><a name="strftime"></a>
<h1>Time variables overview</h1>

<div class="page"><a name="sendping"></a>
<h1>Ping weblog listing services</h1>
<p>
When updating your weblog, you can choose to send an update notification (ping) to various weblog listing services. They provides a list of recently updated weblogs to everyone who requests it. Lots of websites are using this data, so you might receive some extra hits when enabling the ping.
</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For this feature to work correctly, you need to fill out both the weblog URL and the weblog name in the blogsettings.
</p>

</div>

<div class="page"><a name="blogsearchable"></a>

<h1>Always include in search</h1>

<p>When the 'include in search' option is selected, the weblog will <strong>always</strong> be included in searches, even if the search is done on another weblog.</p>

<p>As an example, suppose you have two blogs called 'lifelog' and 'linkdump', with the 'include in search' enabled for 'linkdump'. Now, a search query on 'lifelog' will also search through 'linkdump', while a search query on 'linkdump' will only search entries in 'linkdump'</p>


</div>


<div class="page"><a name="convertbreaks"></a>
<h1>Convert Linebreaks</h1>
<p>
By default, Nucleus converts linebreaks in your items to <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> tags, so a linebreak will also show up in your (X)HTML output
</p>
<p>
Advanced users, or users striving for the semantic web (<tt>br</tt> tags don't add any information, they're just used for markup), might find this feature annoying, and turn this feature off.
</p>
</div>


<div class="page"><a name="media"></a>
<h1>Media</h1>
<p>
Nucleus allows you to upload media files (images, video, sound, ...) to your website
</p>
<p>
Some settings are needed to do this:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Media dir</strong>: location on the server where the media files will be saved (local filesystem)</li>
	<li><strong>Media URL</strong>: location of the media files</li>
	<li><strong>Allow upload</strong>: It's possible to disable file upload</li>
	<li><strong>Allowed filetypes for upload</strong>: a bunch of extensions uploaded files can have (seperated by commas, case insensitive)</li>
	<li><strong>Max. upload file size</strong>: Puts a limit on the size of uploaded files</li>
	<li><strong>Prefix Media Files</strong>: When this option is turned on, uploaded file will be prefixed with the current date. Uploading a file named 'bunny.jpg' on April 8, 2003 will then result in a file named 20030408-bunny.jpg. The reason why you might want to do this, is when you're uploading tons of files, and don't want problems with duplicate names.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each member has his own private collection of media files. Next to that, subdirectories that are under the media dir are seen as global collections (shared between members).
</p>

<p>Uploading is only possible when a member is on the team of at least one of the blogs, to prevent abuse.</p>
</div>


<div class="page"><a name="protectmemnames"></a>
<h1>Protect Member Names</h1>
<p>When this option is enabled, non-logged in members cannot add comments using the same name as registered members. The reason to do this would be to avoid guest impersonating members.</p>
</div>


<div class="page"><a name="pluginurl"></a>
<h1>Plugin URL</h1>
<p>This setting is the base URL for plugin admin areas. Usually it will look like the following</p>
<pre>http://hostname.com/nucleus/plugins/</pre>
</div>

<div class="page"><a name="skinsurl"></a>
<h1>Skins URL</h1>
<p>This setting is the base URL for the Nucleus skins directory. Usually it will look like the following</p>
<pre>http://hostname.com/skins/</pre>
</div>

<div class="page"><a name="actionurl"></a>
<h1>Action URL</h1>
<p>This setting is the absolute URL of the <code>action.php</code> script that comes with Nucleus. Usually it will look like the following</p>
<pre>http://hostname.com/actions.php</pre>
</div>



<div class="page"><a name="additem"></a>
<h1>Adding items</h1>
<p>When adding items to a weblog, there are four kinds of template variables that you can use in the body text, title or extended part:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#templatevar-popup">&lt;%popup(...)%&gt;</a> to insert a popup image</li>
	<li><a href="#templatevar-popup">&lt;%image(...)%&gt;</a> to insert an inline image</li>
	<li><a href="#templatevar-popup">&lt;%media(...)%&gt;</a> to insert a media object</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually, these tags are inserted by the 'insert media' button in the JavaScript toolbar</p>


</div>

<h1>Template variables: Overview</h1>

<h2>What?</h2>

<p>Template variables largely work in exact the same way as skin variables, with the only difference that they are being used inside templates. The variables are called using <code>&lt;%<i>varname</i>%&gt;</code>, and include some text depending on the variable function. Some variables also have extra optional parameters.</p>

<h2>Available variables</h2>

<p>
These template variables be used in the following template-parts: <tt>item header, item body, item footer, date header, date footer, morelink, editlink</tt> (The variables <tt>image</tt>, <tt>popup</tt> and <tt>media</tt> can also be used inside weblog items.)
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#templatevars-basic">Basic variables...</a> (title, body, ...)</li>
	<li><a href="#templatevars-advanced">Advanced variables...</a> (include, plugin, ...)</li>
</ul>

<p>Comments-related template-parts (<tt>comments header, comments body, comments footer, one comment, two comments, comments read more, no comments, too much comments</tt>) have a different set of available variables:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#templatevars-comments">Comments-related variables...</a></li>

<div class="page">
<a name="templatevar-karma"></a>
<h1>Templatevar: karma</h1>

<p>Inserts karma votes data. Karma votes are a method to vote the 'karma' of an item. With a single click, the visitor can vote either positive or negative. The total of all these votes gives an idea of how much an item is liked by the visitors</p>

<h2>Arguments</h2>


<p>Optional:
	<ul>
		<li><strong><em>what</em></strong>: Choose a type of information to be displayed:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>totalscore</strong>: the total karma vote score (=amount of positive votes minus the amount of negative votes) <em>(default)</em></li>
				<li><strong>pos</strong>: total number of positive votes</li>
				<li><strong>neg</strong>: total number of negative votes</li>
				<li><strong>votes</strong>: total number of votes</li>
				<li><strong>posp</strong>: percentage of votes that is positive</li>
				<li><strong>negp</strong>: percentage of votes that is negative</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<pre><code>&lt;%karma(posp)%&gt; out of &lt;%karma(votes)%&gt; were positive</code></pre>


</div>



<div class="page">
<a name="templateitemtitle"></a>
<h1>Templatevar: templateitemtitle</h1>

<p>On comments-releated templateparts, inserts the title of the associated item.</p>

<h2>Arguments</h2>

<p>Optional:
	<ul>
		<li><strong><em>maxlength</em></strong>: When provided, makes the itemtitle behave like the <a href="#templatevar-syndicate_title">syndicate_title templatevar</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

</div>






<div class="page">
<a name="templatevar-author"></a>
<h1>Templatevar: author</h1>

<p>Inserts the name of the author</p>

<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p>Optional:
	<ul>
		<li><strong><em>what</em></strong>: Choose a type of information to be displayed:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>name</strong>: display name <em>(default)</em></li>
				<li><strong>realname</strong>: the real name of the author instead of the display name</li>
				<li><strong>id</strong>: Nucleus membet ID</li>
				<li><strong>url</strong>: URL of members website</li>
				<li><strong>email</strong>: email address of member (use of this one should be avoided)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<pre><code>&lt;%author%&gt;
&lt;%author(realname)%&gt;
&lt;a href="&lt;%author(url)%&gt;"&gt;&lt;%author%&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

</div>




<div class="page">
<a name="templatevar-smartbody"></a>
<h1>Templatevar: smartbody</h1>

<p>
Examines the current item and then decides to show either the body text or the expanded text.
</p>

<p>When the extended part is empty, the body part is chosen. Otherwise the extended part is shown.</p>

<table style="text-align: center;"><tr>
	<th>Part</th><th colspan="2">Empty?</th>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Body</td><td>No</td><td>No</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Extended</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td>
</tr><tr>
	<th>smartbody=</th><th>body part</th><th>extended part</th>
</tr></table>

<h2>Example use</h2>

<p>The body text could be interpreted as your full text, and the extended part could be interpreted as an 'introduction' or 'exerpt', which you want to show on the front page.</p>
<p>In the template used on the front page, you would use <tt>&lt;%smartbody%&gt;</tt> to insert an excerpt (if there is one), or the full text (if no excerpt). In the template for detailed items, <tt>&lt;%body%&gt;</tt> can then be used instead of the usual <tt>&lt;%body%&gt;</tt> + <tt>&lt;%more%&gt;</tt>, since <tt>&lt;%body%&gt;</tt> will contain the full item anyway.</p>




</div>


<div class="page">
<a name="templatevar-morelink"></a>
<h1>Templatevar: morelink</h1>

<p>
Inserts a link to the detail page for the item, as defined in the template (<a href="#templatemorelink">link to extended entry</a>). This is empty when there is no extended part.
</p>

<p>Note that the contents of the 'link to extended entry' templatepart is also parsed and can thus also contain <a href="#templatevars-overview">templatevariables</a>.</p>
</div>


<div class="page">
<a name="templatevar-date"></a>
<h1>Templatevar: date</h1>

<p>
Inserts a date using the <a href="#templatedatetime">date format specified in the template</a>. Optionally, a custom date format can be given as a parameter.
</p>

<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p>Optional
	<ul>
		<li><strong><i>format</i></strong>: format to be used to format the date</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Specials</h2>

<p>Four special parameters are possible:</p>
<ol>
 <li><code>rfc822</code>: RFC822 date in local time</li>
 <li><code>rfc822GMT</code>: RFC date in GMT time</li>
 <li><code>iso8601</code>: ISO-8601 date (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime">W3C Date and Time Format</a> profile). Example: 2002-10-02T10:00:00-05:00</li>
 <li><code>utc</code>: Same as iso8601, but the date is expressed in UTC, using a "Z" for the timezone indicator.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<pre>
&lt;%date%&gt;
&lt;%date(%x)%&gt;
&lt;%date(rfc822)%&gt;
&lt;%date(rfc822GMT)%&gt;
</pre>

<div class="page">
<a name="templatevar-image"></a>
<h1>Templatevar: image</h1>

<p>Inserts an inline image into an item body or template.</p>

<p>In normal use, the image-templatevar is generated automatically when adding images through the media library. You can call it from within templates too, though. Note that in this last case, the image will come out of the media dir of the current item's author.</p>

<h2>Arguments</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Required:</p>
		<table><tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Contents</th>
		</tr><tr>

<p>In normal use, the popup-templatevar is generated automatically when adding images through the media library. You can call it from within templates too, though. Note that in this last case, the image will come out of the media dir of the current item's author.</p>

<h2>Arguments</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Required:</p>

&lt;%popup(myphoto.jpg|50%|50%|this is me, but smaller)%&gt;
</pre>

</div>



<div class="page">
<a name="templatevar-media"></a>
<h1>Templatevar: media</h1>

<p>Inserts a media object into an item body or template.</p>

<p>In normal use, the media-templatevar is generated automatically when adding images through the media library. You can call it from within templates too, though. Note that in this last case, the object will come out of the media dir of the current item's author.</p>

<h2>Arguments</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Required:</p>
		<table><tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Contents</th>
		</tr><tr>
			<td>filename</td>

</div>


<div class="page">
<a name="templatevar-edit"></a>
<h1>Templatevar: edit</h1>

<p>
From within your template, you can add an 'edit item' link by using this template variable. By default, it will link to a popup-bookmarklet-window, but that behaviour can be changed through the <a href="#templateeditlink">editlink template</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> only logged in members that are allowed to edit the item will see this link. In other cases, the edit-templatevar does nothing at all.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>An example for the item body template</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;%title%&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;%body%&gt; &lt;%morelink%&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="metadata"&gt;
	&lt;%edit%&gt; &lt;%comments%&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

<h2>Results in</h2>

<div class="example">
<h4 style="margin:2px;">Title</h4>
<p style="margin:2px;">This is an item</p>
<div style="margin:2px;"><a href="#templatevar-edit">edit</a> - <a href="#templatevar-edit">5 comments</a></div>
</div>

</div>


<div class="page">
<a name="templatevar-editlink"></a>
<h1>Templatevar: editlink</h1>

<p>
Insert a link to the 'edit item' bookmarklet. This can be used in the <a href="#templateeditlink">editlink template</a> for simplicity.
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The <a href="#templateeditlink">'edit link'-template</a> could look like this:</p>
<pre>
&lt;a href="&lt;%editlink%&gt;"
   onclick="&lt;%editpopupcode%&gt;"&gt;edit&lt;/a&gt; -
</pre>

</div>


<div class="page">
<a name="templatevar-editpopupcode"></a>
<h1>Templatevar: editpopupcode</h1>

<p>
To open a popup window for the 'edit link' window, you'll need to add some javascript code to your link. To avoid having to enter this code in the 'edit link'-template, you can insert it using the editpopupcode-templatevar.
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>See the example for the <a href="#templatevar-editlink">editlink templatevar</a></p>
</div>



<div class="page">
<a name="plugins"></a>
<h1>Plugins</h1>
<p>
Nucleus allows you to install custom plugins, adding extra functionality. Plugins can do different things:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Act as a skin variable</li>
	<li>Act as a template variable</li>
	<li>Hook into events generated by Nucleus. The 'move up' and 'move down' links in 'manage plugins' screen can be used to define the order in which plugins will be called when such an event occurs. The first plugin in the list will be called first, the last one will be called last.</li>
	<li>Act as actors when called through <tt>action.php</tt></li>
</ol>
<p>
Note that the responsibility for plugins is entirely with the plugin author. He should make sure that everything works fine.
</p>
<a name="getplugins"></a>
<p>
There are two main repositories where you can find plugins for Nucleus CMS:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://wiki.nucleuscms.org/plugin" title="Plugin Wiki">English</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://japan.nucleuscms.org/wiki/plugins" title="Japanese Plugin Wiki">Japanese</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Neither or these repositories is entirely complete. You will find some plugins in one, but not in the other, and vice versa.
Do not be scared off of one or the other on account of locale, as there are a few free translation services on the Internet that
will help you get by.
</p>
Another resource that will help you while working with plugins is the search function at the
<a href="http://forum.nucleuscms.org/" title="Support Forum">support forum</a>. You will even find some
smaller plugins on the forum that never made it to the wiki.
<p>
</p>
</div>

<div class="page">
<a name="parser-properties"></a>
<a name="includemode"></a>
<a name="includeprefix"></a>
<h1>Parser Properties</h1>

<p>The available parser options are described below.</p>

<table>
 <caption>Parser properties</caption>
 <tr>
 	<th>Option Name</th>
	<th>Values</th>
 </tr><tr>
 	<td>IncludeMode</td>
	<td>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>normal</strong>: normal behaviour; included files are taken relative to the directory/url of the .php file generating the page.</li>
			<li><strong>skindir</strong>: included files are taken relative to the skindir/skinurl</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This property affects the following skinvars: <a href="#skinvar-include">include</a>, <a href="#skinvar-phpinclude">phpinclude</a>, <a href="#skinvar-parsedinclude">parsedinclude</a>, <a href="#skinvar-nucleusbutton">nucleusbutton</a></p>
	</td>
 </tr><tr>
 	<td>IncludePrefix</td>
 	<td>
		<p>This property is a prefix that get's added in front of each filename you want to include. For example, if the prefix is <tt>base/</tt> and you want to include <tt>somefile.txt</tt>, you'll end up including <tt>base/somefile.txt</tt></p>
		<p>This property is intended to be used in conjunction with the IncludeMode property. This way, a skin imported to <tt><em>skindir/</em>somename/</tt> can set <tt>IncludeMode</tt> to <tt>skindir</tt> and <tt>IncludePrefix</tt> to <tt>somename/</tt></p>
		<p>This property affects the following skinvars: <a href="#skinvar-include">include</a>, <a href="#skinvar-phpinclude">phpinclude</a>, <a href="#skinvar-parsedinclude">parsedinclude</a>, <a href="#skinvar-nucleusbutton">nucleusbutton</a></p>
	</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The <tt>IncludePrefix</tt> and <tt>IncludeMode</tt> properties can be set globally for a skin in the general settings of a skin. Also note that from the moment a property is set, it applies to all parsed data, thus also for templates.</p>
