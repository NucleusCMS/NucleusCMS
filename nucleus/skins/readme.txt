Nucleus skins directory
-----------------------

PLEASE NOTE: the skinbackup.xml or skindata.xml files in these directories are not where you should edit the skins. These files get generated by the Nucleus skin export function and are meant to distribute skins between Nucleus users.

To edit skins, open the Nucleus Admin Area, and select 'skins' in the left menu.
