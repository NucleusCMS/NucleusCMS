Nucleus skins directory
-----------------------

PLEASE NOTE: the skinbackup.xml or skindata.xml files in these directories are not where you should edit the skins. These files get generated by the Nucleus skin export function and are meant to distribute skins between Nucleus users.

To edit skins, open the Nucleus Admin Area, and select 'skins' in the left menu.

PLEASE NOTE: the .htaccess file in this directory is intended to prohibit, for enhanced security, direct access .inc and .php files in the skin folders. Depending on the web server configuration, the code in this .htaccess file may not work as intended. In this case, your site will be displayed incorrectly, with missing content or style. Renaming the .htaccess file should fix the problem.
