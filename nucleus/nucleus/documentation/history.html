		<b>Nucleus v1.1 (April 30, 2002)</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Started assuming that at least PHP 4.0.5 is available. (for older PHP versions, some small code-changes should do the trick)</li>
			<li>Added bookmarklets for Mac/IE5 users and Mozilla. Also, made the title of the page also show up in the title field of the new item. Makes more sense. <small>(thanks to <a href="http://www.35mm.org">Ricardo Lamego</a>)</small></li>
			<li>Made the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.predefined.php" title="see PHP doc">predefined PHP variables</a> available in scripts called through &lt;%phpinclude(..)%&gt; <small>(thanks to <a href="http://www.polskaya.be/">Polskaya</a> for noticing the problem)</small></li>
			<li>Fixed: &lt;%additemform%&gt; and &lt;%nucleusbutton%&gt; didn't work when admin area was not in a dir named 'nucleus'</li>
			<li>Added: &lt;%sitevar(adminurl)%&gt; and shortcut &lt;%adminurl%&gt; to include the URL of the admin area</li>
			<li>Changed all references to nucleus.demuynck.org into references to <a href="http://nucleuscms.org/">nucleuscms.org</a></li>
			<li>Extra settings: cookie domain, cookie path, secure cookie (for https)</li>
			<li>Instead of stripping tags in comments, &lt; and &gt; are now replaced by their entities (&amp;lt; and &amp;gt;). This way, greater than and lower than signs can be used in comments <small>(inspiration by <a href="http://www.adfundum.be/">Steven Verbruggen</a>)</small></li>
			<li>Added charset to language files, so international character sets can be used when needed <small>(<a href="http://forum.nucleuscms.org/viewtopic.php?t=56">forum</a>)</small></li>
			<li>Added an extra content-type attribute to skins, so the output type can be set correctly by Nucleus</li>
			<li>Removed the 'headlines' skin and templates. Don't want new users to get too confused.</li>
			<li>Notification emails now also get the senders display name</li>
			<li>All errors now handled by doError method in globalfunctions.php (makes it easier when you want to use your own error handler instead of the error skin)</li>
			<li>Site-members can now override the default site-language setting for the pages they visit</li>
			<li>Added skinvars &lt;%otherarchive%&gt; and &lt;%othersearchresults%&gt; for use on archive/search pages.</li>
			<li>Skinvar &lt;%searchform%&gt; now takes an optional parameter: blogname (for which you want a search form)</li>
			<li>Introducing categories! (new settings; new skinvars category, categorylist and ifcat; new template vars &lt;%category%&gt;, &lt;%catid%&gt; and &lt;%categorylink%&gt;; new optional category params for skinvars blog, otherblog, archive, otherarchive, archivelist, otherarchivelist)</li>
			<li>Fixed: error skin didn't get copied on skin cloning</li>
			<li>Even more new skinvars to make skinning easier: &lt;%todaylink%&gt;, &lt;%archivelink%&gt;, &lt;%prevlink%&gt; and &lt;%nextlink%&gt; <small>(<a href="http://forum.nucleuscms.org/viewtopic.php?t=67">forum</a>)</small></li>
			<li>Fixed: The install script was giving warnings about uninitialized variables on some PHP configurations</li>
			<li>Moved version history to separate file</li>
			<li>Made upgrade scripts a little more robust and more verbose</li>
			<li>XML-RPC: <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi">metaWeblog API</a> support</li>
			<li>XML-RPC: &lt;title&gt; and &lt;category&gt; tags can now be used with the Blogger API (similar to b2)</li>
			<li>Fixed problem with create account <small>(<a href="http://forum.nucleuscms.org/viewtopic.php?t=92">forum</a>)</small></li>
			<li>Made it so Nucleus still works when using PHP &gt;4.1.0 with register_globals turned off, which is the default setting for new installations <small>(<a href="http://forum.nucleuscms.org/viewtopic.php?t=95">forum</a>)</small></li>
			<li>Media library: popup now requests login when needed</li>
			<li>Media library: option to auto-prefix uploaded files with date (turned on by default)</li>
			<li>Backup/Restore: backup file name now has date + nucleus.sql renamed to install.sql + extra "I'm sure"-checkbox on restore to avoid errors <small>(<a href="http://forum.nucleuscms.org/viewtopic.php?t=100">forum</a>)</small></li>
			<li>Javascript toolbar: simpler version available that works in Mozilla</li>
			<li>Fixed: Closed items don't show 'no comments' link anymore <small>(forum)</small></li>
			<li>Fixed: Drafts items don't result in 'January 1970' entries in archivelist</li>
			<li>Fixed: Added &lt;image&gt; tag to xmlrss skin for new installs. It's required. (defaults to a nucleus logo, up to you to change it)</li>
			<li>Fixed: Error with restore (content with semicolons in it would not get restored)</li>
			<li>Added: Extra notification options</li>
			<li>Archives can now also be accessed by day, and an extra daylink template var is available in date headers</li>
			<li>Fixes in default skin</li>
			<li>As always, lots of small fixes &amp; code rewrites</li>
